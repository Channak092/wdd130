        Welcome to Channak's Family Farm Website. In 2015, our family moved from Phnom Penh to Tbong Khmum province, where we started the idea of establishing an organic farm. Many people today face health problems, especially when it comes to eating foods that contain chemicals. Our family is no different, because eating our chemically treated vegetables and fruits takes a lot of time in the hospital. This is why we started this organic farm so that we can have safe food so that we can get healthy. And we can help people understand the importance of starting a natural vegetable garden in their home so they can have safe food to eat every day. In our organic farm we have tour that people can come and see our farm and they can learn how they can start their own organic garden in their home. In our farm have shop that we can buy organic vegetables and fruits that we grow without using chemicals. Have many people come to visit our farm every day and they are so happy because they can learn how to grow safely vegetables and fruit and they can buy good product that they can eat now for get healthy before their vegetables that they grow can eat.

      <h3>Our Tours</h3>
      <p>
        Our Organic Farm has started giving visitors the great opportunity to spend half a day in the core of its activities. Indeed, we have opened our farm for visits in order to show our guests how organic farming really happens. We are very happy and proud to guide our visitors during this discovery offering a glimpse of the diversity of local organic agriculture on our land. Our farmers are pleased to share their farming knowledge and the day to day operation and challenges of farming organically. During the visit, you will have the opportunity to see all our crops and farm-related activities, and you will be able to harvest vegetables yourself. The collected money is supportive and fully reinjected in our farming activities. For those of our visitors who are not much in touch with farming, we hope that this escapade will be an opportunity to raise your understanding of what farming represents and how sacred growing food is. Reconnecting to nature is to us something essential that a lot of people need in our modern society. If you are inclined to that reconnection, we hope to support you in it. The farm tour provides interactive farm experiences, supports local economy and introduces individuals of all ages to the many faces of organic agriculture.

      <h3>Our Shop</h3>
      <p>
        After the farmers spent a lot of time cultivating and after harvesting, we packed it and put it in our organic farm shop, which visitors to our farm can buy. Go to their homes to eat with confidence, as it can be the work of our model farmers on our organic farms. Every day we many people that come to visit our organic farm that buy our product and some people they don't come to visit our farm but they come to buy our vegetables and fruit because they know our farmer has grown this vegetables without chemicals. In our shop we can many different vegetables and fruit and sometimes our customer they ask to harvest by themself in our farm because they want fresh vegetables and fruit. Some people they don’t come to our farm to buy vegetables and fruit but they ask our farm prepare vegetables and fruits and deliver to their home for them. Our shop every busy every day because many customers come and sometimes we don't have enough vegetables and fruit to sell to our customer so next year’s we plan to expanse our farm so we have more vegetables and fruit to provide to our customer.

        Our organic cashews are grown out in the farms using certified fertilizers. Once the fruits are mature enough, our farmers will pick them and send them over to the processing facilities which will later separate the nuts for consumption. At Khmer Organic, we provide a variety of cashew nuts ranging from raw cashew nuts to seasoned cashew nuts. These seasonings include salted, red pepper, turmeric, moringa, long pepper, and plain roasted.
